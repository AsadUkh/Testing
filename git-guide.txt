git reset is used when we want to unstage a file and bring our changes back to the working directory.
 git reset can also be used to remove commits from the local repository.


git reset –hard HEAD~1  remove commit and also remove all changes in this commit even from working directory

git reset –soft HEAD~1 This command will remove the commit but would not unstage a file

git reset –mixed HEAD~1 or git reset HEAD~1 – This is the default command  which removes the commit as well as 
            unstages the file and our changes are stored in the working directory.


git revert is used to remove the commits from the remote repository.
