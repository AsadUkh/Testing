Scenario 1
    echo 'a' >> a.txt
    git add a.txt //stage a file
    git reset HEAD // will unstage it
    Whenever we unstage a file, all the changes are kept in the working area.

Scenario 2
    echo 'a' >> a.txt
    git add a.txt //stage a file
    git commit -m 'testing git reset'
    git reset HEAD~1 // it will undo recent commit and unstage file and changes will ve there in weorking directory
  
git reset –hard HEAD~1  remove commit and also remove all changes in this commit even from working directory

git reset –soft HEAD~1 This command will remove the commit but would not unstage a file

git reset –mixed HEAD~1 or git reset HEAD~1 – This is the default command  which removes the commit as well as 
            unstages the file and our changes are stored in the working directory.
Scennario 3 
    echo 'a' >> a.txt
    git add .
    git commit -m 'test1'
    echo 'b' >> b.txt
    git add .
    git commit -m 'test2'
    git reset --hard HEAD~2
